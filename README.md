## Parse W3C Stats Table ##
The parseStatsTable.js script was created to parse the [W3C Browser Statistics Table][1] and [W3C OS Statistics Table][2] into a JSON object which was then converted to XML. The script is inserted into the page along with [JQuery][3] and the parseStats() function is called from the javascript console.
